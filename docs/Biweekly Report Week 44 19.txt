Frontend

Hooked up backend and frontend, added styling to the frontend, validation of fields implemented. Authentication and authorization works, inclusing displaying messages returned from the backend. Outsourced to do list to github's native system. Added switching between (working) components, including a temporary "protected" component that only tells you if you are logged in. Milestone 1 completed. Bare-bones input form for creating offers created, no backend support yet. Need to further discuss what this form actually contains. Currently waiting for backend to implement something to at least be able to test loading, where something has been written but we have no idea if it actually works.
