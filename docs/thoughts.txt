General thoughts:

- Frontend tests fail, as they are pregenerated test and haven't been configured to mock data properly; none of the reasons the tests fail happen in production.
- Price field accepting any value is a business decision, as this allows for compensation in the form of none-monetary items or services.
- The content of any field the user may think of as important can be added to the description; if there is a trend in what is added, it should be feasable to add new fields.
- the user supports address input, the input for this however has been commented out in the name of data privacy, as it is not used anywhere.
- the admin account is named admin. At the moment there is no simple way of adding another admin.
